# Summary

This is Modclubs proposal for the NNS to create an SNS DAO. This forum post is an opportunity for the IC community to learn more about [Modclub](https://modclub.ai) and ask questions.

# About
Modclubâ€™s mission is to support IC dApps by handling resource-intensive tasks like moderation, verification, data labelling and more. 

Modclub provides the IC with fast, accurate, and scalable solutions by leveraging advanced technologies and a global community-driven workforce. It is built fully on-chain, and the first SaaS model application on the IC.

Modclub is a platform that offers a vital service to the IC ecosystem by providing easy-to-integrate moderation and verification solutions. This enables dApps to focus on their core products while also creating earning opportunities for the IC community.

As Modclub transitions into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), customers will have the option to pay for moderation and verification services using MOD tokens, while moderators will be rewarded with MOD tokens for their work.

Modclub's roadmap extends beyond moderation and verification. It will provide structured crowdsourcing opportunities, reminiscent of a modern-day Mechanical Turk. This will allow businesses to tap into its marketplace of moderators for a wide range of use cases, expanding the versatility and potential applications of our platform.


# Proposed Token Distribution

Total token supply: 1 billion MOD tokens

# Notes

Modclub's tokenomics model was developed in collaboration with [Quantum Economics](https://e6p3u-6yaaa-aaaah-abkfq-cai.ic0.app/), a research department of [Bochsler Consulting](https://www.bochslerfinance.com/) and a partner of [Swiss Blockchain Labs](https://swissblockchainlabs.org/). We will be releasing our updated SNS Tokenomics paper later this week!

Modclub will be open-sourcing our code shortly.
